### How to Use

##### CREATING A CATEGORY
* In order to create a category, you have to set 3 required parameters, which are: **Category IDs**, **Category Texts** and **Category Icons IDs**. Here is an example of these three parameters.

     ``[Category IDs]:         primary, secondary, completed, failed``      
     ``[Category Texts]:       Primary, Secondary, Completed, Failed``      
     ``[Category Icons IDs]:   312, 311, 310, 309``      

* In the example above, the "primary" in **Category IDs** will be a category. The text that will be displayed when a quest is in this category is "Primary", and the default icon for this category is the ID "312".
* As I stated earlier, you can have as many categories as you want. You just need to separate the ids, names and icons with a comma (,).
* IMPORTANT: Make sure that you have the same amount of ids, texts and icons. In other words, if you have 4 IDs, you must have 4 Texts and 4 Icons.


##### WRITING A QUEST
* Open the database and go to the section "Common Events"
* Create a common event with the name "PHQuestBook" (without quotation marks)
* Create one or several comments to create quests.
* The comments need to follow a pattern:

    ``{Example of Quest Title|categoryID|iconID}``    
    ``Description of the Quest.``

* The ``[primary]`` is optional. The quest can be ``[primary]``,``[secondary]``, ``[complete]`` or ``[fail]``. If you don't specify the priority of the quest, it will be ``[primary]`` by default.
* The ``iconID`` is also optional. You can put the ID of the icon you want to show for this quest. If you don't specify an item, the quest will get the default for its priority.
* You are allowed to have several comments meaning one quest (you don't need to use just the 6 lines for comments, you can add a new comment right below and keep going).
* You are allowed to write control characters in the description of the quest (such as \C[n], \I[n] \V[n]).
* You are allowed to use some special tags to get the name of an item, weapon, armor, enemy or actor. When you are writing the description of a quest, use the tags ``<enemy:ID>``, ``<actor:ID>``, ``<item:ID>``, ``<weapon:ID>`` and ``<armor:ID>`` to print the name of the particular item on the description. Change ``ID`` for the corresponding number you want.
* There is also a tag called ``[break-on-update]``. When you use it, all the content of the same quest will be hidden, and it will just appear in the quest book when you call the plugin command ``PHQuestBook update Title_of_the_quest``.
* You are allowed to have as many ``[break-on-update]`` as you want. And always when you call the plugin command for updating, it will allow the player to see a new part of the quest (This is a good feature if you want to have a "step-by-step" quest, where each time the player completes the quest, the same quest is updated and new things have to be done).

##### REGISTERING A QUEST ON THE BOOK
* To register a quest in the book, create an event in the map, go to "Plugin Command" and type the command for adding the quest
    Ex.: ``PHQuestBook add Example of Quest Title``
* To check the status or category of the quest, you can use these Script commands:       
    ``PHPlugins.PHQuests.isActive("Title of the Quest");``       
    ``PHPlugins.PHQuests.is("Title of the Quest", "categoryID");``

### NOTES

* ``Example of Quest Title`` does not need to be a single word or between quotation marks, it can be several words meaning one title.
