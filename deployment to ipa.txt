1) Copy deployed www folder to ~/Desktop/work/www/
2) Edit index.html and enter <script type="text/javascript" src="cordova.js"></script>
under <body style="background-color: black">

3) Type in Terminal:
cd ~/Desktop/work/
cordova build
cordova emulate ios

4) Create .ipa:
-open platforms/ios/TheDreamBook.xcodeproj or open in Xcode
-Select “TheDreamBook” in the left pane, and open the project settings. Set the target to “Generic iOS Device" setting it up so that a build can be made for the device.
-Use the same identifier set for the [App ID identifier] configured in 4-2-2 for the [Bundle Identifier].
-Just in case, let's make sure the project is clean. Select [Product] → [Clean] from the file menu.
-Now let's create an archive to and gather all the files into one. Select [Product] → [Archive].
-The Organizer window will open once the archive is successfully made, and the archive for this project will be displayed.
-Right-click the archive and when you select [Show in Finder] you can open the location of the archive file in the Finder.
-The archive will be located relatively deeply nested in folders at /Users/<User Name>/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/Date/ 
-It's possible to also export the package as is using [Export...] in the right pane of the Organizer, but since we want to explicitly specify the provisioning profile, we will export from the terminal. We will use the "xcodebuild" command to export using the terminal. 
-Below is an example of a command.

xcodebuild -exportArchive -archivePath ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/2016-07-16/TheDreamBook\ 7-16-16,\ 10.49\ PM.xcarchive/ -exportProvisioningProfile "The Dream Book" -exportPath ~/Desktop/TheDreamBook.ipa
